This repository contains various scripts related to fMRI data processing, data wrangling, etc. Some (most?) of the scripts have hard-coded directory paths - you will want to change these after downloading so they work on your computer. 
                                                                          
N.B. - some (most?) of these scripts should be considered works-in-progress and may or may not be useful to you in their present form.
